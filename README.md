Advent Of Code 2023 - Attempting in Go!

To make life hard for myself, I'm also using no GUI tools this year which is new to me!
Instead opting for [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) inside a Dev Container running on [toolbx](https://containertoolbx.org/)with the [PodMan](https://podman.io/) container runtime.
